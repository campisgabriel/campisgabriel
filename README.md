# Hi, I'm Gabriel but some people call me GCPðŸ‘‹

I'm an Analytics Engineer and Data Product Manager who loves building useful things with data.

Over the last few years, Iâ€™ve worked on data platforms, pipelines, models, and visualizations, mostly using tools like dbt, BigQuery, Databricks, and Snowflake.

I enjoy connecting business needs with good engineering, and I'm always learning something new.

Youâ€™ll find a few experiments and personal projects here. Thanks for stopping by!
